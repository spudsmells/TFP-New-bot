# Production Recommendations:
# - Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for better performance
# - Set up automated backups of the database
# - Monitor /status regularly for health checks
# - Use /reload-config for hot config updates (no restart needed)
# - Keep logs for at least 30 days
# - Test all features in staging first!
